Task Title: Set up new Git repository and create development branch for 'new-project'

Task Description:

As a developer, I need a new GitHub repository for 'new-project' and i need a development branch so that I can work on new features without affecting the main branch. 
Readme file should contain step-by-step instructions on how we can do it ourselves.

First, go to the GitHub website and log in to your account.

On the top right-hand side of the page, click on the "+" sign and select "New repository".

In the "Repository name" field, enter "new-project". You can also add a brief description of your project in the "Description" field.

By default, GitHub will initialize a new repository with a main branch. To create a development branch, click on the "Add a README file" option and select "Create a new branch".

In the "Branch name" field, enter "development" and select "Create branch".

Now that your development branch has been created, you can start working on new features without affecting the main branch.

To clone the repository to your local machine, click on the green "Code" button on the right-hand side of the page and select "HTTPS". Copy the URL provided.

Open up a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.

Type "git clone " followed by the URL you copied in step 7.

Now that you've cloned the repository, navigate to the new-project directory on your local machine and type "git checkout development" to switch to the development branch.

You can now start working on new features in the development branch without affecting the main branch.
